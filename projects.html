                <h2>EU YOUTH POWER</h2>
                <p>
                    The European Commission has identified technology and open educational resources (OER) as
                    opportunities to reshape EU education. EU education is failing to keep pace with the digital
                    society and economy and also risks lagging behind other regions of the world. The Bulgarian
                    educational system falls within the continental European tradition. Bulgaria’s results in the 2013
                    OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) are close to the EU average (OECD
                    2014). 
                    In line with Europe 2020 goals for smart growth in EU, the NDP BG2020 targets modernization
                    of the educational system with view of providing accessible and high - quality education . The
                    National Reform Strategy (2015 Update) targets for reducing early school leaving by improving
                    the access to education and by enhancing its quality. The Ministry of Education and Science
                    leads the reforms and secures regular rigorous evaluation of the activities funded by the
                    Government and the European Structural and Investment Funds. The short term activities for
                    modernization of the educational system focus on improving the technical infrastructure and
                    equipment at schools, as well as on training the teachers to utilize it.  
                    Moreover, on 30 September 2015 the Bulgarian Parliament adopted conclusively an entirely new
                    Pre-school and School Education Act. The law regulates the adoption of innovations in pre-
                    school and school education, promulgates the continuous professional development of the
                    pedagogical personnel, and involves wide range of stakeholders in the decision making
                    concerning the educational process. The new legal framework creates beneficiary conditions for
                    enhancing access to, and use and quality of, information and communication technologies in
                    education and for training and lifelong learning of teachers. 
                    The training in foreign languages at VET as a final stage of education, especially in the small
                    municipalities, has been overlooked. Consequently, the significant part of East-European young
                    adults is facing insurmountable language barriers in Europe. Lack of communication between
                    young people in EU risks to result a euro-skeptic attitude in VET students and misunderstanding
                    of the concept of European citizenship.   
                    The project is targeted on spreading the understanding of VET students on European citizenship
                    by providing innovative digital tools for social inclusion through edutainment for acquiring new
                    language competences.  It targets VET students and young adults from all over Europe.
                    Innovative digital technologies break the geographical boundaries. The educational game
                    (edutainment tool) will include the VET students in the effort to tear down the language walls in
                    front of the youth of Europe.  The EU Youth Power comes from shared values and shared
                    experiences.   
                    The project builds on innovative methodologies combining innovative digital solutions, design
                    thinking, neuro-science, semi-automated language processing, didactic approach to gamified
                    learning and game theory to engage the VET students in an exciting adventure in Europe to find
                    new places, to cooperate and communicate with young people from different countries in
                    different languages. 
                    The game will complement Erasmus+ Mobility concept. It will encourage &quot;youth travel&quot; in the
                    virtual Europe, use of different languages to solve puzzles and answer quiz questions related to

                    the current location of the player, and social inclusion by providing strong incentives for
                    cooperation and communication between young people of Europe. 
                    The project plans for a series of multiplier events in order to engage as early as possible as many
                    VET teachers, trainers and students in the process of building support for the learning of foreign
                    languages in VET institutions and in refinement and promotion of EU Youth Power game as a
                    tool to facilitate the process. 
                    The goal of the project team is to create a state-of-the-art edutainment tool that will be used by
                    all project partners and external stakeholders as part of their mission to contribute to the social
                    inclusion, promote European citizenship and to utilize the innovative digital tools in the process.
                    In long term the project may impact VET and secondary school students at European scale.

                        <p>
                        The basic attitude we are starting from in implementation of this project is that the youth have problems they are not always able to recognize and explain, they meet with occurrences that they do not haw to name it, they are not able to solve them or they do not who they should address to for help 
                        At the same time their behavior has been noted as deviant influencing the security of the local community and in building the relations with the children from their age and in general the security condition in the municipality. 
                        As the relations are being built towards the older persons, it is as well necessary to built so called code for behavior of the youth toward their generations, elder people and the environment from security aspect. Passing the street, part of them is involved in the traffic, us technical assets and so on they should have higher awareness and should not endanger the life of the other and its own.
