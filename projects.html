                        The basic attitude we are starting from in implementation of this project is that the youth have problems they are not always able to recognize and explain, they meet with occurrences that they do not haw to name it, they are not able to solve them or they do not who they should address to for help 
                        At the same time their behavior has been noted as deviant influencing the security of the local community and in building the relations with the children from their age and in general the security condition in the municipality. 
                        As the relations are being built towards the older persons, it is as well necessary to built so called code for behavior of the youth toward their generations, elder people and the environment from security aspect. Passing the street, part of them is involved in the traffic, us technical assets and so on they should have higher awareness and should not endanger the life of the other and its own.
